# Version 1.0.0
-   **Breaking change**: new CLI which provides help and supports the commands `tot` `pol_hk` and `thermal_hk` to provide three different analysis: a global one, the polarimeter housekeeping one and the thermal sensors one. The official_pipeline can be used both from the command line and through some handy TOML files. [#3](https://github.com/Frastandreetto/StripThesis/pull/3)

# Version 0.1.0
